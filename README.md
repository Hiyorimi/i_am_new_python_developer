#I am Python Developer 

###Python and minimal env setup script for Linux and OSX 

###Distros supported:

Ubuntu
OSX (requires XCode/GCC to be installed. Install command line tools via XCode->preferences to install GCC)

###What this gives you:

Homebrew (OSX only)
Python defined by .python-version
Pyenv / pipenv
Git
Please note: If you are running on a super slow connection your sudo session may timeout and you'll have to enter your password again. If you're running this on an EC2 or RS instance it shouldn't be problem.


This setup script is based on Pavel Pavlenko's "I am RoR Developer" setup [script](https://github.com/pavlik/i_am_ror_developer). Thanks, Pavel!
